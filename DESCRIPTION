Description: Recent advances in sample preparation, processing and mass
  spectrometry (MS) have enabled the emergence of MS-based single-cell
  proteomics (SCP). `QFeatures` along with its extension `scp` allow for
  standardized analysis of SCP data. `QFeatures` is based on the
  `SummarizedExperiment` and `MultiAssayExperiment` Bioconductor classes.
  Assays in a `QFeatures` object have a hierarchical relation: proteins
  are composed of peptides, themselves produced by spectra. Throughout
  the aggregation and processing of these data, the relations between
  assays are tracked and recorded. `QFeatures` is further able to track
  those relations across hundreds of acquisition batches that are
  usually required for SCP experiments. Users can therefore easily
  navigate across spectra, peptide and protein quantitative data within
  or between acquisition batches. In this workshop, we will reproduce an
  existing SCP data analysis on a subset of the original dataset. We
  will demonstrate how to import data containing multiple acquisition
  batches as `QFeatures` objects, how to process and analyse data in
  `QFeatures` objects, and how to interpret the results. Along the road,
  we will highlight the current limitation in the field when it comes to
  analysing SCP data, namely showing the presence of important batch
  effects and data missingness. Some familiarity with Bioconductor data
  analysis, in particular the `SummarizedExperiment` class, and basic
  knowledge about single-cell analyses are recommended to follow this
  workshop.
