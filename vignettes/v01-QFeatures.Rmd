## Introduction

`QFeatures` is a package for the manipulation of mass spectrometry 
(MS)-based quantitative proteomics data. The quantitative data is 
generally obtained after running a preprocessing algorithm on raw MS 
profiles called spectra. The algorithm attempts to match each spectra 
to a peptide database to infer the peptide sequence. A spectrum
for which a corresponding peptide could be found is called peptide to
spectrum match (PSM). The intensities recorded by the MS are then 
used to quantify the PSMs. The quantified PSMs are used as input by 
`QFeatures` and undergo various data wrangling steps to reconstruct
the peptide data and then the protein data, usually of interest for 
elucidating the biological question at hand. 

MS-based quantification data can be represented as a matrix of 
quantitative values for features (PSMs, peptides, proteins) arranged 
along the rows, measured for a set of samples, arranged along the 
columns. The matrix format is a common representation for any 
quantitative data set. We will be using the `SummarizedExperiment` 
[@SE] class:

```{r sefig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Schematic representation of the anatomy of a `SummarizedExperiment` object. (Figure taken from the `SummarizedExperiment` package vignette.)"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/SE.png")
```

- The sample (columns) metadata can be access with the `colData()`
  function.
- The features (rows) metadata can be access with the `rowData()`
  column.
- If the features represent ranges along genomic coordinates, these
  can be accessed with `rowRanges()`
- Additional metadata describing the overall experiment can be
  accessed with `metadata()`.
- The quantiative data can be accessed with `assay()`.
- `assays()` returns a list of matrix-like assays.

## QFeatures

While mass spectrometers acquire data for spectra/peptides, the
biological entity of interest are the protein. As part of the data
processing, we are thus required to **aggregate** low-level
quantitative features into higher level data.

```{r featuresplot, fig.cap = "Conceptual representation of a `QFeatures` object and the aggregative relation between different assays.", echo = FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(NA, xlim = c(0, 12), ylim = c(0, 20),
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",
     xlab = "", ylab = "", bty = "n")

for (i in 0:7)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")


for (i in 8:12)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")

for (i in 13:18)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "orange", border = "white")

for (i in 19)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")


for (i in 5:7)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")

for (i in 8:10)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")

for (i in 11:13)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "orange", border = "white")

for (i in 14)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")

rect(9, 8, 12, 8+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")
rect(9, 9, 12, 9+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")
rect(9, 10, 12, 10+1, col = "orange", border = "white")
rect(9, 11, 12, 11+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")

segments(3, 8, 5, 8, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 6, 5, 7, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 4, 5, 6, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 0, 5, 5, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 10, 5, 9, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 11, 5, 10, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 13, 5, 11, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 14, 5, 12, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 16, 5, 13, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 19, 5, 14, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 20, 5, 15, lty = "dashed")


segments(8, 5, 9, 8, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 8, 9, 9, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 11, 9, 10, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 14, 9, 11, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 15, 9, 12, lty = "dashed")
```

We are going to start to familiarise ourselves with the `QFeatures`
class implemented in the
[`QFeatures`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/articles/QFeatures.html)
package. The class is derived from the Bioconductor
`MultiAssayExperiment` [@MAE] class. Let's start by loading the
`QFeatures` package.

```{r pkgs, message = FALSE}
library("QFeatures")
```

Next, we load the `feat1` test data, which is composed of single
*assay* of class `SummarizedExperiment` composed of 10 rows and 2
columns.

```{r load_feat1}
data(feat1)
feat1
```

Let's perform some simple operations to familiarise ourselves with the
`QFeatures` class:

- Extract the sample metadata using the `colData()` accessor (like you
  have previously done with `SummarizedExperiment` objects).

```{r cd}
colData(feat1)
```

- Extract the first (and only) assay composing this `QFeaures` data
  using the `[[` operator (as you have done to extract elements of a
  list) by using the assay's index or name.

```{r assay1}
feat1[[1]]
feat1[["psms"]]
```

- Extract the `psms` assay's row data and quantitative values.

```{r rd}
assay(feat1[[1]])
rowData(feat1[[1]])
```

## Feature aggregation


The central functionality of the `QFeatures` infrastructure is the
aggregation of features into higher-level features while retaining the
link between the different levels. This can be done with the
[`aggregateFeatures()` function](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/reference/QFeatures-aggregate.html).

The call below will

- operate on the `psms` assay of the `feat1` objects;
- aggregate the rows the assay following the grouping defined in the
  `peptides` row data variables;
- perform aggregation using the `colMeans()` function;
- create a new assay named `peptides` and add it to the `feat1`
  object.

```{r agg1}
feat1 <- aggregateFeatures(feat1, i = "psms",
                           fcol = "Sequence",
                           name = "peptides",
                           fun = colMeans)
feat1
```

- Let's convince yourself that we understand the effect of feature
  aggregation and repeat the calculations manually and check the
  content of the new assay's row data.

```{r cm}
## SYGFNAAR
colMeans(assay(feat1[[1]])[1:3, ])
assay(feat1[[2]])["SYGFNAAR", ]

## ELGNDAYK
colMeans(assay(feat1[[1]])[4:6, ])
assay(feat1[[2]])["ELGNDAYK", ]

## IAEESNFPFIK
colMeans(assay(feat1[[1]])[7:10, ])
assay(feat1[[2]])["IAEESNFPFIK", ]
```

```{r rd2}
rowData(feat1[[2]])
```

We can now aggregate the peptide-level data into a new protein-level
assay using the `colMedians()` aggregation function.

```{r agg2}
feat1 <- aggregateFeatures(feat1, i = "peptides",
                           fcol = "Protein",
                           name = "proteins",
                           fun = colMedians)
feat1
assay(feat1[["proteins"]])
```


## Subsetting and filtering

The link between the assays becomes apparent when we now subset the
assays for protein A as shown below or using the `subsetByFeature()`
function. This creates a new instance of class `QFeatures` containing
assays with the expression data for protein, its peptides and their
PSMs.

```{r prota}
feat1["ProtA", , ]
```

The `filterFeatures()` function can be used to filter rows the assays
composing a `QFeatures` object using the row data variables. We can
for example retain rows that have a `pval` < 0.05, which would only
keep rows in the `psms` assay because the `pval` is only relevant for
that assay.

```{r ff1}
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ pval < 0.05)
```

On the other hand, if we filter assay rows for those that localise to
the mitochondrion, we retain the relevant protein, peptides and PSMs.

```{r ff2}
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ location == "Mitochondrion")
```

As an exercise, let's filter rows that do not localise to the
mitochondrion.


```{r ff3}
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ location != "Mitochondrion")
```
